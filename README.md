## Mini-Gallery Web Project

### Show me the site
[here you go](https://nl.purplesquid.ca)

### What is it?
*part 1:*
	This website is a project aimed at providing a unmet service for the tabletop miniature community. Currently artists wishing to share their painted miniatures do so on facebook groups or platforms like instagram, the problem with this system is that these images are very difficult to find, facebook is not searchable and instagram while searchable does not provide relevant enough results to be useful. This website makes it easy to search images and discover new artists.  
  
*part 2:*
	Currently stores and clubs for many miniature wargames run leagues for their local Communities with the admins managing league registration and matchmaking by hand. This website also provides tools for league administrators to automate the managment of their leagues.

### Current Scope and Status

The gallery features detailed searchable tags allowing users to find the speficic content they are looking for.

The league manament tools allow for league admins to easily track participant registration information as well as allowing registered league participants to easily submit results of gameplay. Matchmaking can be done manually or automatically.

The groups and organizations catagory connects the league managment tools and the gallery together with the intention of giving equal exposure to the gameplay and artistic sides of the hobby while helping users find the type of content that appeals to them.

A first pass of the export to social media feature is implemented, this system will need to be iterated on but exists now as a proof of concept while i collect feedback about the type of functonality desired by the features users.


### Future Development

Implement proper cacheing for the webserver

Image previews and thumbnails can be cleaned up to be much more efficent.

Research database indexing and best practices for searching data, lazy lookups across large datasets will get expensive fast.

Do a deep dive on web security.
